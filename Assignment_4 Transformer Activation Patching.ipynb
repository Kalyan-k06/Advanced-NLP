        "It's important to understand that there is no block or set of layers that individually correspond to a residual stream in the transformer; rather, it is a conceptual interpretation of the transformer architecture that captures the fact that,  due to residual connections within the transformer blocks, one can look at the flow of information (i.e., the vector representations) as being *read from* by the transformer blocks (i.e., reading results of previous computations), and then *writing* the results of the attention calculations back to the representations (via linear operations applied to previous representations).\n",

        "Activation patching is an interpretability method for *causal intervention* on the computational mechanisms of the model: certain results of the computations are injecte and the effect that these results have on the outcome are observed.  Certain representations computed in one pass through the model are taken (i.e., representations from the *clean run*) and injected into another (the *corrupted run*). These injected representations are called the patch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Patching techniques are quite tricky to work with since patching something in an intermediate layer affects not only the local layer, but also all the downstream computations. To be able to retrieve meaningful results, careful comparison and, e.g., freezing of subsequent representations is required.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below is an example of using activation patching for the task of identifying which model internals are responsible for recalling landmark information. How does the model complete the prompt “The Colosseum is in” with the answer “Rome”? We'll implement this using the library [`transformer_lens`](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens).\n",

        "Recall from the slides that our metric for determining the which model internals is based on a simple metric--- the difference in the logits of the correct token, given different inputs. This metric leverages an old insight from LLM-based modelling:  a model can perform a task well if it assigns higher log probabilities (i.e., the logits are higher) for correct predictions that for incorrect ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then pick a specific model activation, run the model on the corrupted prompt, but then intervene on that activation and patch in its value when run on the clean prompt. We then apply the metric, and see how much this patch has recovered the clean performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
